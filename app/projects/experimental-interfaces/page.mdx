          The best interfaces don&apos;t feel like interfaces at all. They feel like extensions of thought.

          ## Current Explorations
          
          I&apos;m investigating interaction patterns that feel more natural and intuitive than traditional UI paradigms.

          - Gesture-based navigation that mimics physical intuition
          - Contextual interfaces that adapt to user intent
          - Micro-interactions that provide meaningful feedback
          - Spatial computing interfaces for 3D environments

          ## Philosophy
          
          Most interfaces today are still trapped in desktop metaphors from the 1980s. We&apos;re designing for screens, but thinking is spatial and embodied.

          What if interfaces responded to the way we naturally move, gesture, and think? What if the boundary between tool and thought became blurred?

          ## Prototypes
          
          Currently building experimental prototypes that explore:

          - Voice + gesture multimodal controls
          - AI-assisted interface generation
          - Haptic feedback systems for web interfaces
          - Eye-tracking for implicit user research

          Each prototype challenges a fundamental assumption about how we interact with computers.
