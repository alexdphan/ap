          The fastest way to test an idea is to build the smallest version that can demonstrate the core concept.

          ## Philosophy
          
          Perfect is the enemy of good, and good is often the enemy of fast. When testing new concepts, speed of iteration matters more than code quality.

          The goal isn&apos;t to build production-ready software. It&apos;s to answer specific questions as quickly as possible.

          ## Current Experiments
          
          - Voice-controlled development environments
          - AI-assisted code review tools
          - Real-time collaborative design systems
          - Browser automation for testing workflows

          ## Tools & Stack
          
          For maximum speed, I lean on tools that let me focus on the unique parts of each prototype:

          - Next.js for web apps
          - Vercel for instant deployment
          - Tailwind for rapid styling
          - Supabase for backend needs
          - Framer Motion for interactions

          ## Learnings
          
          Most ideas don&apos;t work. The ones that do work often work for different reasons than you initially thought.

          The prototype that takes 2 weeks to build will teach you more than 6 months of planning.

          Build fast, learn fast, kill fast, iterate fast.
