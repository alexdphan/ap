          Joining Browserbase as the first GTM hire, it was hard to know where to start. I decided that doing a simple demo is where it shines.

          This was my leap toward SF, I noticed common patterns and boosted growth by being relatable—evoking reactions that are commonly experienced by others.

          This was when I caught the emotions evoked by SF tech culture and decided to build projects focused on emotion—leading users down the rabbit hole to discover what Browserbase eventually came to be.

          The biggest takeaway was that people wanted to have a personal connection to the brand itself, so how I questioned how can we scale deep relationships with our customers?

          <SectionHeading>The start of an inspirational emotion</SectionHeading>

          I've begun to sense a feel of the culture over time, and I realized that people often seek inspiration from brands - to create action.

          I knew that SF was a "bubble" somewhat, so I began developing memes that feel relatable, and capture the audience that would use our products at Browserbase

          The memes had a lot of traction, so what better solution could I make than using an AI agent that was made with Browserbase?

          This was one of the most viral products on X. It led to a crypto coin that had a market cap of 1m and rugged, youtube reviews on the website, and the highest used project on Browserbase for the day.

          Over 55,000 memes are made to this day.

          My learnings out of this is that if you build anything that envokes a strong emotion, people will naturally gravitate to the source.

          People will even go out of their way to not only use the product, but review the product itself. I've never experienced this before, so it was a new experience for me.

          **Organic validation at scale.** YouTubers reviewed Brainrot.run without outreach, proving viral engagement money can't buy.

                     Surprisingly, our highest-value customers discovered us through projects like this.

          <SectionHeading>The Barnacle on a Whale</SectionHeading>

          Being part of a smaller startup, one of the important things I valued over time was becoming a "barnacle on a whale"

          What does this mean? Incumbents over time have had an existing audience they could launch products towards.

          One of the things I was proud at Browserbase was always finding a way to respond in the most meaningful ways.

          When Anthropic launched Computer Use, we figured out how to implement this alongside our product

          When OpenAI launched Operator, we launched Operator in less than 24 hours.

                     When Anthropic launched Computer Use, we were among the first to implement it.

                     Even when Gemini launched its Image Generation, I somehow included myself into the picture

          Everything felt seamless, we sent the message that "if these incumbents can build these AI tools and systems, you can too"

                     This created a win-win: we gained visibility while helping larger players demonstrate real-world use cases of their technology.

          The best growth strategy for developer tools is building something developers genuinely want to use and share—sometimes in ways you never expected.
