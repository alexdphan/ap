          As the first growth engineer at Browserbase, I&apos;m building the foundation for scalable user acquisition and engagement systems.

          ## What I&apos;m Building
          
          Growth engineering isn&apos;t just about metrics - it&apos;s about building systems that make the right behaviors feel natural and inevitable.

          - Experimentation infrastructure for rapid A/B testing
          - User onboarding flows that reduce time-to-value
          - Analytics systems that surface actionable insights
          - Automated lifecycle marketing triggers

          ## Approach
          
          The best growth systems are invisible. They work in the background, nudging users toward success without feeling manipulative or forced.

          I focus on understanding the user journey deeply - where do people get stuck? What makes them successful? How can we remove friction while adding value?

          ## Impact
          
          Building the growth engine for a developer tool requires a different approach than consumer products. Developers are skeptical of growth tactics, so everything must provide genuine value.

          The systems I&apos;m building focus on education, clear value demonstration, and removing technical barriers to adoption.
