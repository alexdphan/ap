    Joining Browserbase as the first GTM hire, it was hard to know where to start. I decided that doing a simple demo is where it shines.

    This was my leap toward SF, I noticed common patterns and boosted growth by being relatable—evoking reactions that are commonly experienced by others.

    This was when I caught the emotions evoked by SF tech culture and decided to build projects focused on emotion—leading users down the rabbit hole to discover what Browserbase eventually came to be.

    The biggest takeaway was that people wanted to have a personal connection to the brand itself, so how I questioned how can we scale deep relationships with our customers?

    I've begun to sense a feel of the culture over time, and I realized that people often seek inspiration from brands - to create action.

    I knew that SF was a "bubble" somewhat, so I began developing memes that feel relatable, and capture the audience that would use our products at Browserbase

    The memes had a lot of traction, so what better solution could I make than using an AI agent that was made with Browserbase?

    This was one of the most viral products on X. It led to a crypto coin that had a market cap of 1m and rugged, youtube reviews on the website, and the highest used project on Browserbase for the day.

    Over 55,000 memes are made to this day.

      The best growth strategy for developer tools is building something developers genuinely want to use and share—sometimes in ways you never expected.
