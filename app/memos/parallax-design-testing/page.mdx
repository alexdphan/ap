          Parallax scrolling gets a bad reputation because it's often overused. But when applied thoughtfully, it can create depth and hierarchy that guides attention naturally.

          <SectionHeading>Principles for Good Parallax</SectionHeading>
          
          Parallax should serve the content, not distract from it. The motion should feel natural and help users understand the spatial relationship between elements.

          Use subtle speed differences rather than dramatic effects. The goal is to create depth, not motion sickness.

            The best parallax effects feel inevitableâ€”like the natural consequence of scrolling through a three-dimensional space.

          Performance is critical. Parallax effects can quickly become janky if not optimized properly.

          Use CSS transforms and will-change properties to enable hardware acceleration. Debounce scroll events and use requestAnimationFrame for smooth animations.

          Consider reduced motion preferences. Some users get motion sick or have vestibular disorders. Always provide alternatives.

          Test on mobile devices early and often. What feels smooth on desktop might be unusable on slower devices.

          Parallax works best for storytelling and creating visual hierarchy. It can guide users through a narrative or help them understand complex information.

          Layer background elements at different speeds to create depth. Foreground content should move at normal scroll speed while backgrounds move slower.

          Use parallax to reveal information progressively. Let elements appear and disappear at natural points in the scroll journey.

          Combine with other interaction patterns like sticky elements or fade-ins to create rich, layered experiences.
