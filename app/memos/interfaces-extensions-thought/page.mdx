          When you're writing with a good pen, you stop thinking about the pen. Your thoughts flow directly onto the page. The tool becomes invisible.

          <SectionHeading>The Transparency Principle</SectionHeading>
          
          Transparent interfaces let you focus on what you're trying to accomplish, not on how to operate the tool.

          This transparency emerges from deep understanding of user mental models. The interface should match how people naturally think about the problem, not how the system works internally.

          <Callout>
            The interface should feel like a natural extension of human capability, not a foreign system to be learned.

          <SectionHeading>Beyond Visual Design</SectionHeading>
          
          Interface design isn't just about layouts and colors. It's about information architecture, interaction patterns, and feedback systems.

          The best interfaces provide the right information at the right time, in the right format, with the right level of detail.

          They anticipate what you need next. They remember what you've done before. They adapt to your workflow rather than forcing you to adapt to theirs.

          Every click, every screen transition, every notification is an opportunity to either support or interrupt your thinking process.

          <SectionHeading>The Design Process</SectionHeading>
          
          Start by understanding the cognitive task, not the technical requirements. What is the user trying to think through? What decisions are they making?

          Map the natural flow of thought from initial intention to final outcome. Where do people get stuck? What information do they need at each step?

          Prototype early and test with real users doing real tasks. Watch where their attention goes. Notice where they hesitate or look confused.

          The goal is to eliminate the gap between thought and action.

          When the interface disappears, the user's full cognitive capacity can focus on the actual problem they're trying to solve.
