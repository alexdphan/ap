          Every complex system has unofficial shortcuts. Most people don't see them. Those who do often ignore them. But these backdoors are where leverage lives.

          We're trained to follow the official process. Use the proper channels. Go through the right people. This conditioning makes us blind to the actual flow of power and information.

          Most backdoors look like bugs, not features. They seem too simple, too obvious, or too good to be true. We dismiss them before we understand their potential.

            The best opportunities don't come with announcements. They come disguised as problems.

          <SectionHeading>The Practice</SectionHeading>

          Start by mapping how things actually work versus how they're supposed to work. The gaps between intention and reality are where backdoors live.

          Look for recurring complaints in your organization. Each complaint points to a friction point. Friction points are just unpaved paths waiting for someone to see them.

          Pay attention to workarounds. When people consistently bypass a system, they're teaching you something about the system's inadequacy and revealing an opportunity.

          Find the people who seem to get things done impossibly fast. Study their methods. They've discovered paths that others haven't.

          The question isn't whether backdoors exist. The question is whether you're looking for them.
