          The backdoors that are often overlooked are usually the most obvious ones - the patterns we dismiss because they seem too simple or too direct.

          In software, we spend enormous effort on complex architectures while ignoring the simple configuration file that could solve the problem in five lines.

          In business, we build elaborate funnels while the biggest conversion improvement might be fixing a broken checkout button.

          In life, we optimize elaborate systems while ignoring that we just need to sleep better.

          ## Why We Miss Them
          
          Simple solutions don&apos;t feel important. They don&apos;t signal intelligence or sophistication. There&apos;s no glory in fixing the obvious thing.

          But often the obvious thing is obvious because it&apos;s fundamental. It&apos;s the foundation that everything else depends on.

          ## The Practice
          
          Before building anything complex, ask: what&apos;s the most embarrassingly simple version of this?

          Before optimizing the system, ask: what basic assumptions haven&apos;t we questioned?

          Before adding features, ask: what&apos;s broken about what we already have?

          The backdoor is usually hiding in plain sight.
