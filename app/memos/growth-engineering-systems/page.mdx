          Growth engineering isn't about tricking people into using your product more. It's about building systems that make the right behaviors feel natural and inevitable.

          <SectionHeading>The Systems Approach</SectionHeading>
          
          Most teams think about growth as a series of tactics: emails, notifications, viral loops. But tactics without systems are just noise.

          Systems thinking asks: what are the underlying forces that drive behavior? How can we amplify the forces that lead to desired outcomes?

          <Callout>
            The best growth engineering feels invisible. Users don't realize they're being "grown" because the experience just makes sense.

          Every interface is a behavioral intervention. Every interaction shapes user expectations and habits.

          Instead of asking "how do we get users to do X," ask "what system would make X the obvious next step?"

          Look for places where friction serves no purpose except to slow people down. Remove it.

          Find moments where a little guidance would save users significant confusion. Add it.

          Build feedback loops that help users understand the value they're getting from their actions.

          <SectionHeading>The Measurement Problem</SectionHeading>
          
          Growth engineering requires different metrics than product engineering. You're not just measuring what happened; you're measuring what changed.

          Focus on leading indicators: behaviors that predict future value rather than metrics that just reflect past activity.

          Cohort analysis becomes essential. You need to understand how user behavior evolves over time, not just what's happening right now.

          The goal isn't to optimize for growth. The goal is to build systems so good that growth becomes a natural byproduct.
